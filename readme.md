# This is a classical implementation of Shor's factorization algorithm

### This project are suplementary for future jurnal.

usage it's simple, the program just need `N` as input which is a number you want to factorize.

To-do:
- [x] Repair vector element access
- [ ] Add thread
- [ ] Add for CUDA
- [ ] Make the program can accept argument from console
- [ ] Add for Quantum Computing Version
